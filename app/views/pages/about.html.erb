        <p>
          With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.
        </p>

        <p>
          For this reason I put communication at the top pariority with every project. Project management tools can help but the end result is up to the user, me and you. Daily phone meetings are ideal for reporting progress or to clear the way ahead: setting up goals and milestones.
